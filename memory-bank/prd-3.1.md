# PRD 3.1: Hyper-Personalization Engine

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for **Phase IV: The Hyper-Personalization Engine**. The goal is to leverage our existing, powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) service to transform the SnapAMeal user experience from a reactive tool into a proactive, intelligent health companion. By embedding personalized, AI-driven insights deeper into the entire app journey, we will create a system that feels uniquely tailored to each user's specific health goals, preferences, and daily activities.

This phase focuses on making our AI more proactive and contextual, leveraging the rich user data and the sophisticated `RAGService` to deliver timely, relevant, and actionable guidance.

## 2. Goals

*   **Increase User Engagement**: Drive daily app usage by providing fresh, personalized content and insights that are directly relevant to the user's journey.
*   **Improve Health Outcomes**: Guide users more effectively toward their goals by turning their own data into actionable feedback and structured "missions."
*   **Enhance Feature Adoption**: Showcase the power of our AI across the app, not just on a dedicated "AI Advice" page.
*   **Strengthen Community Bonds**: Foster more meaningful interactions by using AI to facilitate relevant discussions and justify social connections.
*   **Deliver a "Wow" Experience**: Create a magical, personalized feedback loop that makes users feel understood and supported.

## 3. Feature Breakdown

The Hyper-Personalization Engine will be implemented across four key areas of the application:

### 3.1. Proactive, Contextual Health Coach

The AI will move beyond a reactive Q&A model to offer unsolicited, timely insights throughout the user's daily experience.

*   **Dynamic "Insight of the Day" on Dashboard**:
    *   **Description**: The home dashboard will feature a card displaying a unique, daily tip generated by the `RAGService`.
    *   **User Story**: As a user, when I open the app, I want to see a new piece of advice tailored to my specific goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain) and dietary needs (e.g., vegetarian), so I feel motivated and learn something new each day.
    *   **Implementation**: Use the existing `HealthQueryContext` to generate a goal-specific query against the Pinecone knowledge base each day.

*   **Post-Meal Log Insights**:
    *   **Description**: Immediately after a user logs a meal, provide a contextual insight connecting the meal to their health goals.
    *   **User Story**: As a user focused on muscle gain, after I log "chicken and rice," I want the app to give me immediate, positive feedback explaining why this is a good choice for my goal.
    *   **Implementation**: Utilize the existing `generateNutritionInsights` function in the `RAGService`.

### 3.2. Goal-Driven User Journeys

The application will dynamically adapt the user's journey based on their primary health goal.

*   **RAG-Generated "Missions"**:
    *   **Description**: Upon selecting a health goal, the user will be presented with a personalized, AI-generated starter plan or "mission."
    *   **User Story**: As a new user targeting weight loss, I want the app to give me a simple, actionable "First 7 Days" plan so I know exactly where to start.
    *   **Implementation**: Prompt the `RAGService` to generate a simple, beginner-friendly plan based on the user's `currentGoals` and `activityLevel`.

*   **Hyper-Personalized Content Feed**:
    *   **Description**: The main social feed will be augmented with articles, tips, and videos from our knowledge base that are directly relevant to the user's goals.
    *   **Implementation**: The `RAGService` will periodically query for content matching the user's `HealthQueryContext` and inject it into their feed.

### 3.3. RAG-Infused Social Features

The AI will be used to make community interactions smarter and more meaningful.

*   **AI-Powered Conversation Starters**:
    *   **Description**: In health-focused community groups, the app will generate relevant discussion topics to spark engagement.
    *   **User Story**: As a member of a "Fasting Support" group, I'd like to see interesting questions posted by the app that get the conversation going.
    *   **Implementation**: Query the `RAGService` for "common challenges" or "interesting facts" related to the group's theme.

*   **Enhanced Friend Matching Justifications**:
    *   **Description**: When suggesting new friends, the AI will provide a specific, personalized reason for the match.
    *   **User Story**: As a user, I want to know *why* someone is being recommended to me, such as, "You both follow a 16:8 fasting schedule and are focused on improving energy."
    *   **Implementation**: Use the `RAGService` to find commonalities in user profiles and goals to generate a natural language justification.

### 3.4. Personalized Weekly & Monthly Reviews

A new, highly engaging feature will provide users with personalized summaries of their own activity.

*   **"Your Weekly Review" Feature**:
    *   **Description**: At the end of each week, deliver a personalized summary that re-interprets the user's activity (stories, meal logs, etc.) through a health lens.
    *   **User Story**: As a user, I want a weekly notification that takes me to a summary of my progress, highlighting my achievements and connecting them to my goals with insights from the app's knowledge base.
    *   **Implementation**: Deploy the existing `generateWeeklyDigest` and `generateMonthlyDigest` functions from the `RAGService` and build a new UI to display the results.

## 4. Technical Requirements

*   No new major dependencies are required. This initiative primarily leverages the existing `RAGService`, `OpenAIService`, and Pinecone integration.
*   The `HealthQueryContext` will be the primary data object used for personalization.
*   New UI components will be needed for:
    *   The "Insight of the Day" dashboard card.
    *   The post-meal log insight notification/display.
    *   The "Missions" or goal-based starter plans.
    *   The Weekly/Monthly Review summary page.
*   Backend logic will be required to trigger these RAG-powered events (e.g., daily cron job for insight of the day, post-meal log trigger).

## 5. Success Metrics

*   **Engagement**:
    *   Increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) by 15%.
    *   Increase in the average number of sessions per user per day.
    *   At least 60% of users viewing their "Weekly Review" each week.
*   **Retention**:
    *   Increase in Day 7 and Day 30 user retention by 10%.
*   **Feature Adoption**:
    *   At least 50% of new users will complete the first step of their AI-generated "Mission."
*   **Qualitative Feedback**:
    *   User survey feedback indicating the app feels "personalized," "motivational," and "intelligent."
