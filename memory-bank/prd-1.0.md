# Product Requirements Document: SnapAMeal

## Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the specifications for developing "SnapAMeal," a mobile application replicating Snapchat's core features, including ephemeral messaging, stories, and social interaction. Built with Flutter for cross-platform development and Firebase for backend services, SnapAMeal will enable users to share temporary photos and videos, apply simple AR filters, manage friends, and engage in real-time communication, all while ensuring privacy and scalability.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goal is to deliver a Snapchat-like experience emphasizing real-time, ephemeral content sharing and social connectivity. Specific objectives include:

*   Providing an intuitive, camera-centric user experience for spontaneous interaction.
*   Ensuring robust data privacy and security to build user trust.
*   Achieving high performance and scalability for a growing user base.
*   Complying with legal and regulatory requirements, avoiding patent infringement.
*   Fostering engagement through features like streaks and AR filters.

## Target Audience

SnapAMeal targets teenagers and young adults (aged 13â€“30) who value authentic, spontaneous communication and are familiar with social media platforms. This demographic enjoys creative expression and real-time friend interactions.

## Features and Functionality

### 1. Ephemeral Messaging

*   **Screenshot Notifications**: Alert senders when recipients screenshot snaps.

**Technical Specs**:

*   **Media Capture**: Flutter's camera package for photo/video capture with customizable view times.
*   **Storage**: Firebase Storage for temporary media hosting; Firestore for metadata (sender, recipient, view status).
*   **Deletion**: Firebase Cloud Functions to delete media post-viewing or expiration.
*   **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for replay and screenshot alerts.

### 2. Stories

*   **Story Posting**: Share photos/videos visible to selected friends for 24 hours.
*   **Multiple Views**: Allow repeated story views within 24 hours.

### 3. AR Filters and Camera Effects

*   **Simple AR Filters**: Offer basic filters (e.g., face distortions, color effects).
*   **Accessible Interface**: Filters accessible via swipe/tap from the camera view.

**Technical Specs**:

*   **Basic Filters**: Flutter's `image` package for simple effects; native ARKit (iOS) and ARCore (Android) via platform channels for face-based filters.
*   **Performance**: Optimize filter rendering for smooth camera previews.

### 4. Chat and Group Messaging

*   **One-on-One Chat**: Text chats disappear after both parties view or after 24 hours if unopened.
*   **Group Messaging**: Support chats for up to 16 users with the same disappearing rules.
*   **Message Saving**: Users can save messages to persist them.

**Technical Specs**:

*   **Real-Time Messaging**: Firestore collections with real-time listeners for chats.
*   **Deletion**: Cloud Functions to enforce disappearing rules.
*   **Group Support**: Efficient Firestore queries for multi-user chats.

### 5. User Authentication and Friend Management

*   **Secure Authentication**: Register/login via email, phone, or social media.
*   **Friend Management**: Search/add/remove friends; sync contacts optionally.
*   **Friend Suggestions**: Suggest friends based on mutual connections.

**Technical Specs**:

*   **Auth**: Firebase Authentication with OAuth for social logins.
*   **Database**: Firestore for user profiles and friend relationships.
*   **Search**: Firestore queries for username-based friend lookup.

### 6. Streaks

*   **Streak Mechanism**: Track consecutive daily snap exchanges between friends.
*   **Streak Indicators**: Show count and emoji (e.g., ðŸ”¥) next to friends' names.
*   **Notifications**: Alert users to maintain/restore streaks.

**Technical Specs**:

*   **Tracking**: Firestore streak collection with timestamps and counts.
*   **Updates**: Real-time listeners for streak status; FCM for expiration alerts.

## User Experience (UX)

*   **Camera-Centric Interface**: Opens to camera view with front/rear camera toggle.
*   **Intuitive Navigation**: Gesture-based (swipe left: chats, right: stories, down: friends).
*   **Notifications**: Alerts for snaps, messages, and streaks via FCM.
*   **Onboarding**: Multi-step tutorial with skip options.
*   **Accessibility**: Voice-over support, high-contrast UI, inclusive AR filters.

**Technical Specs**:

*   **Camera**: Flutter camera package with gesture recognizers (`PageView`).
*   **Notifications**: FCM with in-app banners.
*   **Onboarding**: Custom Flutter widgets or `intro_views_flutter`.
*   **Accessibility**: Flutter's `Semantics` for screen readers.

## Technical Requirements

*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Flutter for iOS/Android.
*   **Real-Time Synchronization**: Firestore real-time listeners.
*   **Secure Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with encryption.
*   **Efficient Media Handling**: Firebase Storage with compression and lazy loading.
*   **AR Integration**: Platform channels for ARKit/ARCore.

*   **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions, FCM).
*   **AR**: Native AR libraries or Flutter packages.
*   **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics.

## Phased Implementation Plan

This project will be implemented in phases to ensure a stable foundation and manage complexity.

### Phase 1.1: Foundational Setup & Core Authentication

This initial phase focuses on establishing the core infrastructure and user identity systems.

1.  **Task: Configure Android Environment:** Resolve the current blocker by setting up and testing the Android development environment for Flutter and Firebase.
2.  **Task: Set Up Firebase Project:** Create the project in the Firebase console and correctly integrate the configuration files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) into the Android and iOS projects.
3.  **Task: Implement Email/Password Authentication:**
    *   Build the UI for registration and login screens.
    *   Integrate with Firebase Authentication for user creation and sign-in.
    *   Upon registration, create a corresponding user document in a `users` collection in Firestore.
    *   Implement an `AuthGate` to manage user sessions and direct users to the correct screen (login vs. home).
4.  **Task: Solidify Firestore Security Rules:** Write and deploy the initial security rules for Firestore to protect user data. Rules should ensure a user can only create their own profile and cannot read/write other users' private data.

### Future Phases (Next Steps)

Once the foundation is in place, development will proceed with the following feature sets, which will be broken down into their own detailed implementation phases:

*   **Core Messaging:**
    *   Friend Management (search, add, remove friends)
    *   One-on-One Chat
    *   Ephemeral Messaging (Snaps)
*   **Social Features:**
    *   Stories
    *   Group Messaging
    *   Streaks
*   **Advanced Features (High-Risk R&D):**
    *   AR Filters (Requires native integration and should be treated as a separate, high-effort task).

## Success Metrics

*   **User Acquisition and Retention**: 10,000 users in 3 months; 60% 30-day retention.
*   **Engagement Metrics**: 5 snaps/DAU; 50% daily story engagement.
*   **User Satisfaction**: 4.5/5 app store rating; SUS score >80.
*   **Performance Metrics**: <2-second load times; 99.9% crash-free rate.
*   **Privacy Compliance**: Zero breaches; GDPR/CCPA compliance.

**Technical Specs**:

*   **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics for engagement tracking.
*   **Monitoring**: Firebase Crashlytics for performance and crash reporting.
*   **Compliance**: Firestore security rules; data deletion workflows.

## Security and Compliance

*   **Data Encryption**: Firebase encryption for data at rest and in transit.
*   **Ephemeral Content**: Ensure media deletion post-viewing via Cloud Functions.
*   **Privacy Controls**: Firestore-stored settings for story visibility.
*   **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA adherence with consent and deletion options.
*   **Patent Avoidance**: Legal review to avoid infringing Snap Inc. patents.

## Conclusion

SnapAMeal, built with Flutter and Firebase, delivers a robust, scalable Snapchat clone. Flutter ensures a seamless cross-platform UX, while Firebase provides real-time synchronization, secure authentication, and efficient media handling. Challenges like AR integration and ephemeral content management are addressed through careful planning, ensuring the app meets its goals and success metrics.
