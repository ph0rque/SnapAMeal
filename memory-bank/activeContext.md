## Current Focus

The immediate goal is to move beyond the "Hello World" application and begin implementing the core features of the Snapchat clone.

## Next Steps

The next logical step is to build out the basic navigation structure of the application. This will likely involve a bottom navigation bar to switch between the camera, chat, and stories sections.
