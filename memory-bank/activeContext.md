## Current Focus

**MAJOR PIVOT: SnapAMeal Phase II - Health & Fitness Focus**

The project is pivoting from a completed Snapchat clone to a health and fitness tracking application that leverages the existing social media infrastructure while adding AI-powered meal tracking, fasting features, and RAG-enhanced personalization.

## Phase Transition Summary

### Phase I Complete (Snapchat Clone)
- âœ… Full Snapchat functionality implemented and production-ready
- âœ… All core features working (messaging, stories, camera, AR)
- âœ… Clean, maintainable codebase with 94% issue reduction
- âœ… Firebase integration fully configured
- âœ… Cross-platform builds successful

### Phase II Direction (Health & Fitness)
- ðŸŽ¯ **New Persona**: Alex (38, Marketing Coordinator, weight loss goals)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Core Pivot**: From general social messaging to health-focused social tracking
- ðŸŽ¯ **Key Innovation**: RAG-powered AI for personalized health advice and content
- ðŸŽ¯ **Architecture Addition**: Vector DB + LLM integration for intelligent features

## Immediate Next Steps (Clarification Needed)

Before proceeding with Phase II development, several critical questions need clarification:

### 1. **Foundation Strategy**
- Should we build Phase II features on top of the existing Snapchat codebase?
- Or start fresh with a new health-focused app architecture?
- How much of the existing social infrastructure (friends, chat, stories) should be preserved?

### 2. **Technical Architecture**
- Which RAG stack components to prioritize (Vector DB selection)?
- Budget/API constraints for LLM integration (GPT-4 vs open-source)?
- Meal recognition: Custom model vs existing APIs (like Clarifai Food)?

### 3. **User Experience**
- How aggressive should the "fasting mode" content filtering be?
- Should existing users be migrated or is this a separate app?
- Privacy requirements for health data (HIPAA considerations)?

### 4. **Development Scope**
- Is this a 6-month project or longer-term initiative?
- Team size and technical expertise available?
- Priority order for the 6 main features if resources are limited?

## Current State Assessment

**Advantages from Phase I:**
- Proven Flutter/Firebase architecture
- Working camera and media systems
- Established social features (can be repurposed for health communities)
- Clean codebase ready for extension

**New Technical Challenges:**
- RAG implementation and vector database integration
- Computer vision for meal recognition
- AI model fine-tuning and personalization
- Health data privacy and compliance
- Real-time AI inference performance

## Awaiting Clarification

The project is paused pending user clarification on the strategic and technical questions above. Once these are resolved, detailed task breakdown and implementation planning will proceed.
