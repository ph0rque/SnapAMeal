- **Code Quality**: All fixes pass `flutter analyze` with zero errors

### Previous Fix: My Meals UI Image Loading (COMPLETED) ✅

**🔧 COMPLETE FIX**: Resolved My Meals UI Image Loading Issue! ✅

### Issue Resolution: Missing Images in My Meals UI
- ✅ **Problem Identified**: My Meals page was loading corrupted meal documents with null `image_url` and `image_path` fields
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Historical documents from when image upload was failing (before content validation fix)
- ✅ **Solution Applied**: Added filtering in My Meals page to skip corrupted documents that lack proper image URLs or user IDs
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track how many corrupted documents are skipped vs. valid meals loaded
- ✅ **User Experience**: Users now only see properly saved meals with valid images, while corrupted documents are silently filtered out

### Technical Implementation:
- **Primary Fix**: `lib/pages/my_meals_page.dart` - Added filtering logic in `_loadMeals()` method to skip corrupted documents
- **Filter Logic**: Skip meals where `meal.imageUrl.isEmpty || meal.userId.isEmpty` to exclude corrupted documents  
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed tracking of total documents vs. valid meals vs. skipped corrupted documents
- **User Experience**: Only properly saved meals with valid images are now displayed in My Meals UI
- **Data Integrity**: Corrupted historical documents are filtered out without user disruption
- **Code Quality**: Fixed linting issues and passes `flutter analyze` with zero issues

### Database Cleanup (Ready for Manual Execution):
- **Cleanup Scripts Created**: Multiple cleanup scripts created (`cleanup_corrupted_meals.ts`, `cleanup_corrupted_meals.dart`, `find_corrupted_meals.js`)
- **Manual Cleanup Guide**: Provided Firebase Console instructions for deleting corrupted documents
- **Identification Criteria**: Documents with null/empty `image_url`, `image_path`, or `user_id` fields
- **Firebase Console URL**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/snapameal-cabc7/firestore
- **Target Collection**: `meal_logs` collection contains the corrupted historical documents
- **Expected Result**: After cleanup, My Meals UI will only show properly saved meals with images

### Debugging Enhancements Applied:
- ✅ **Pre-upload Validation**: File existence, size, and format checks before Firebase Storage upload
- ✅ **Firebase Connectivity**: Test Firebase Storage reference creation before upload attempts
- ✅ **Upload Progress**: Real-time upload progress monitoring with detailed logging
- ✅ **URL Validation**: Verify download URL format and accessibility after upload
- ✅ **Firestore Verification**: Immediate read-back verification of saved documents
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Messages**: Detailed error logging with retry functionality
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Improved error snackbars with 10-second duration and retry buttons

### Technical Implementation:
- **File Modified**: `lib/pages/meal_logging_page.dart` - Enhanced `_saveMealLog()` method
- **Validation Added**: File existence, size limits (10MB), and Firebase Storage connectivity tests
- **Progress Monitoring**: Upload progress logging and state tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Retry functionality and detailed error reporting
- **Data Integrity**: Pre-save validation and post-save verification of Firestore documents

### Next Steps for Testing:
1. **Run the app** and take a photo of food using the meal logger
2. **Check debug console** for detailed upload logs starting with 🔄, 📤, ✅, or ❌
3. **Look for specific errors** in the enhanced error messages
4. **Use retry functionality** if upload fails

## Previous Focus: Non-Food Detection Bug Fix (COMPLETED) ✅

**🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Non-Food Image Detection Now Working Properly! ✅

### Bug Fix Implementation: Proper Non-Food Image Handling
- ✅ **Issue Identified**: Images of non-food items were returning generic "Mixed Food" labels instead of proper "not food" messages
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Hybrid processing bypassed OpenAI food validation when TensorFlow Lite gave high confidence results (≥ 0.7)
- ✅ **Architectural Fix**: Restructured meal analysis to always validate food presence with OpenAI first, before any TensorFlow processing
- ✅ **New Flow**: OpenAI food validation → (if food detected) → TensorFlow optimization → Result processing
- ✅ **Exception Propagation**: Fixed catch block to re-throw `NonFoodImageException` while preserving fallback for technical errors  
- ✅ **User Experience**: Users now see clear "This image doesn't contain food" message with "Try Again" action button
- ✅ **System Integrity**: OpenAI Vision API's food validation (`contains_food: false`) now functions as designed for ALL images
- ✅ **Performance**: Maintains TensorFlow optimization for actual food images while ensuring non-food detection
- ✅ **Code Cleanup**: Removed 120+ lines of unused hybrid processing methods (`_determineMealTypeFromFoods`, `_mergeDetectionResults`, etc.)

### Technical Details:
- **Primary Fix**: `lib/services/meal_recognition_service.dart` - Restructured `analyzeMealImage()` method (lines 169-205)
- **Architecture Change**: OpenAI food validation now always happens first, regardless of TensorFlow availability/confidence
- **Exception Handling**: Fixed catch block to re-throw `NonFoodImageException` (lines 442-448)
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused methods: `_determineMealTypeFromFoods`, `_mergeDetectionResults`, `_isTypicalRawIngredient`, `_isTypicalPreparedFood`, `_areItemsSimilar`
- **UI Integration**: `MealLoggingPage` already had proper exception handling for `NonFoodImageException`
- **Testing**: Code passes `flutter analyze` with zero issues, cleaner and more maintainable
