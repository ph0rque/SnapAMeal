# Active Context

## Current Focus: Unified User System Implementation (COMPLETED) âœ…

**ðŸ”„ MAJOR REFACTOR COMPLETE**: Unified Demo and Regular Users into Single System! âœ…

### Latest Implementation: System Unification
- âœ… **Service Unification**: All services (FriendService, SnapService, ChatService, InAppNotificationService) now use standard collections
- âœ… **Demo Collection Removal**: Eliminated all `demo_*` collections in favor of unified `users`, `friend_requests`, `notifications`, `chat_rooms`, etc.
- âœ… **Firestore Rules Simplification**: Removed 200+ lines of demo-specific rules, simplified to standard collection rules
- âœ… **Code Cleanup**: Removed all `_getUsersCollectionName()`, `_isDemoUser()`, and collection switching logic
- âœ… **Demo User Integration**: Demo users (Alice, Bob, Charlie) now exist as regular users in standard collections
- âœ… **Snap Sharing Fix**: Resolved snap sharing issues by ensuring all users use same collection structure
- âœ… **Friend Relationships**: All friendship logic unified - no more separate demo friendship handling
- âœ… **Chat System**: All chat rooms, messages, and notifications use standard collections
- âœ… **Simplified Architecture**: Clean, maintainable codebase with single data model for all users

### Why This Change Was Critical:
- **Complexity Reduction**: Eliminated dual collection system that was creating maintenance overhead
- **Bug Prevention**: Fixed snap sharing and friendship issues caused by collection mismatches  
- **Code Maintainability**: Single codebase path instead of branching logic throughout services
- **Feature Consistency**: All users get identical feature access regardless of demo status
- **Database Efficiency**: Consolidated data structure reduces duplication and confusion

### Previous Implementation: In-App Notification System âœ…
- âœ… **InAppNotificationService**: Complete notification tracking for friend requests, messages, group invitations, AI advice
- âœ… **NotificationBellWidget**: Badged bell icon with unread count and interactive dropdown
- âœ… **Health Dashboard Integration**: Notification bell added to health dashboard header
- âœ… **Service Integration**: Automatic notification creation in FriendService and ChatService  
- âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Stream-based unread count with immediate emission + 10-second refresh
- âœ… **Action Handling**: Tap notifications to accept friend requests, open chats, view groups
- âœ… **WIDGET LIFECYCLE FIX**: Fixed PopupMenuButton deactivated widget error with proper StreamSubscription disposal
- âœ… **ERROR HANDLING**: Added comprehensive error handling, null checks, and mount state validation
- âœ… **FIRESTORE RULES**: Proper security rules for all notification collections
- âœ… **REAL-TIME REFRESH**: Manual refresh triggers for immediate badge count updates
- âœ… **COMPREHENSIVE CLEAR**: "Clear all" clears notifications, friend requests, AND marks messages as viewed
- âœ… **UNIQUE USER NOTIFICATIONS**: Each user gets personalized notifications that can be cleared

### Hyper-Personalization Engine Final Status:

- âœ… **Phase 2**: Goal-Driven Journeys (RAG missions, personalized content feed)
- âœ… **Phase 3**: RAG-Infused Social Features (AI conversation starters, enhanced friend matching)
- âœ… **Phase 4**: Personalized Reviews (weekly/monthly summaries with AI insights)
- âœ… **Infrastructure**: Content safety, user preferences, fallback content system

### Latest Completion Summary:
- âœ… **AI Content Preferences**: Comprehensive user preference system with granular controls
- âœ… **Fallback Content System**: 636+ lines of safe, goal-appropriate content for all AI features
- âœ… **Service Integration**: Full dependency injection with AIPreferenceService registration

### Recent Code Quality & Bug Fixes (January 2025):
- âœ… **SYSTEM UNIFICATION**: All users now use identical service architecture and data collections
- âœ… **SNAP SHARING RESTORED**: Fixed photo/video sharing between users by unifying collection structure
- âœ… **CODE SIMPLIFICATION**: Removed 300+ lines of demo-specific logic across multiple services
- âœ… **FIRESTORE OPTIMIZATION**: Consolidated rules from 600+ lines to ~420 lines
