- **Data Storage**: Firebase Firestore with comprehensive security rules
- **Image Storage**: Firebase Storage for meal photos
- **Real-time**: Firebase for live updates and synchronization

The foundation is strong for continuing with enhanced story features that leverage the health and fitness context.

## Current Focus

**Task 3.0: AI-Powered Meal Recognition and Logging System**

Currently implementing the comprehensive meal recognition and logging system for SnapAMeal Phase II. This task builds on the completed RAG architecture (Task 1.0) and fasting timer system (Task 2.0) to provide AI-powered meal analysis with nutrition tracking.

## Progress on Task 3.0

**Completed Sub-tasks (3/7)**:
- ‚úÖ **3.1**: Research and integrate TensorFlow Lite for meal recognition
  - Added `tflite_flutter`, `image`, and `image_picker` dependencies
  - Implemented fallback strategy using OpenAI Vision API for food detection
  - Created comprehensive food classification system with confidence scoring

- ‚úÖ **3.2**: Create meal snap capture and preprocessing pipeline
  - Built comprehensive `MealLog` data model with full nutrition tracking
  - Created `MealRecognitionResult`, `FoodItem`, `NutritionInfo` models
  - Added mood rating, hunger level, and recipe suggestion support
  - Integrated bounding box detection and allergen warning system

- ‚úÖ **3.3**: Implement calorie and macro estimation algorithms
  - Built `MealRecognitionService` with dual AI approach (TensorFlow Lite + OpenAI Vision)
  - Implemented local nutrition database with USDA-style nutrition facts
  - Created AI-powered nutrition estimation with GPT-4 integration
  - Added comprehensive allergen detection and confidence scoring

**In Progress (4/7 remaining)**:
- ‚è≥ **3.4**: Build AI caption generation system (witty, motivational, health tips)
  - Caption generation methods already implemented in MealRecognitionService
  - Need to integrate with UI and test different caption types

- ‚è≥ **3.5**: Create meal logging UI with photo, tags, and mood tracking  
  - `MealLoggingPage` created with full functionality
  - `MealCardWidget` created for displaying logged meals
  - Need to integrate with navigation and test camera functionality

- ‚è≥ **3.6**: Implement RAG-enhanced recipe suggestions based on meal content
  - Recipe suggestion generation already implemented in MealRecognitionService
  - Uses existing RAG service to find relevant healthy recipes
  - Need to refine recipe data structure and improve suggestions quality

- ‚è≥ **3.7**: Add meal logging to Firestore with proper data structure
  - Firestore integration already implemented in MealLoggingPage
  - Need to create proper security rules and indexes
  - Need to test end-to-end meal logging workflow

## Technical Implementation Details

**Architecture Decisions Made**:
- **Dual AI Strategy**: TensorFlow Lite for local processing + OpenAI Vision API for fallback
- **Comprehensive Nutrition Database**: Local USDA-style nutrition facts with AI estimation fallback
- **RAG Integration**: Recipe suggestions use existing RAG service for contextual recommendations
- **Firebase Storage**: Meal images stored in Firebase Storage with proper cleanup
- **Mood & Hunger Tracking**: 5-point scale system integrated with meal logs

**Key Services Created**:
- `MealRecognitionService`: Core AI-powered meal analysis
- `MealLog`: Comprehensive data model for meal tracking
- `MealCardWidget`: Beautiful UI component for displaying meal logs
- `MealLoggingPage`: Full-featured meal capture and logging interface

**Dependencies Added**:
- `tflite_flutter: ^0.10.4` - TensorFlow Lite for local ML inference
- `image: ^4.1.7` - Image processing and manipulation
