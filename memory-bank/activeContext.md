### Next Priority: Task 5.0 Sub-tasks:
1. **5.1**: Repurpose existing chat service for health-focused group types
2. **5.2**: Create specialized group categories (fasting, calorie goals, workout types)
3. **5.3**: Implement shared streak tracking between group members
4. **5.4**: Build AI-based friend/group suggestion system using RAG and user similarity
5. **5.5**: Add anonymity mode for sensitive health sharing
6. **5.6**: Update group chat UI with health-specific features and themes

### Implementation Notes:
- Story permanence system provides engaging long-term content retention
- Logarithmic algorithm creates natural milestone progression
- Cloud Functions ensure efficient story lifecycle management
- Beautiful UI shows permanence status and encourages engagement
- RAG-powered summaries provide meaningful insights over time

### Technical Architecture:
- **AI Services**: OpenAI (GPT-4, Vision API, Embeddings) + TensorFlow Lite
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for RAG knowledge retrieval
- **Data Storage**: Firebase Firestore with comprehensive security rules
- **Cloud Functions**: Story expiration management and permanence calculation
- **Real-time**: Firebase for live updates and engagement tracking

The foundation is strong for continuing with health-focused community features that leverage the existing social infrastructure.
