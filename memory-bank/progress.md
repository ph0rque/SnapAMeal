# Progress

## What Works

-   The development environment is confirmed to be working for iOS, macOS, web, and Android.
-   The Firebase project (`snapameal-cabc7`) is set up and configured in the app for all platforms.
-   A basic multi-page authentication flow structure exists.
-   A `stage` branch has been created for development work.

## What's Left to Build

-   The core application logic and UI need to be implemented according to the PRD.

## Known Issues

-   The iOS bundle ID was inconsistent with the project name and had to be corrected. This is now resolved.
-   The Android development environment is not yet configured.
