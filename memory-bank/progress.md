  - Backend Cloud Functions for deleting viewed/expired snaps.
- **Phase 3: Social Features** is complete. This includes:
  - Stories with 24-hour auto-deletion
  - Group messaging
  - Streaks tracking
- **Code Quality & Bug Fixes**: Comprehensive cleanup completed (January 2025):
  - Fixed all critical errors (test imports, Firebase configuration)
  - Removed all unused code, imports, and variables
  - Updated all deprecated APIs (themes, color methods)
  - Replaced debug print statements with proper logging
  - Fixed async context issues with proper mounted checks
  - Updated dependencies (camera package 0.10.6 → 0.11.1)
  - **Reduced from 49 issues to 3 minor warnings (94% improvement)**
  - **RESOLVED: CocoaPods dependency conflict** (January 2025):
    - Updated `google_mlkit_face_detection` from 0.11.0 to 0.13.1
    - Updated `google_mlkit_commons` from 0.8.1 to 0.11.0
    - Fixed GoogleMLKit/GoogleDataTransport version conflicts
    - iOS pod installation now successful

## Current Status

**MAJOR PIVOT: Phase II Health & Fitness Transformation**

SnapAMeal is transitioning from a completed Snapchat clone to a health & fitness tracking app with AI/RAG capabilities. The foundational Snapchat features remain as the base architecture.

**Phase I (Original Snapchat Clone) - COMPLETE**:
- ✅ All core Snapchat features implemented
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ✅ Firebase properly configured
- ✅ iOS CocoaPods dependency conflicts resolved

**Phase II (Health & Fitness with AI) - IN PROGRESS**:

**Task 1.0 - RAG Architecture Foundation** (COMPLETE - 6/6 sub-tasks):
- ✅ Pinecone vector database setup and configuration
- ✅ OpenAI API integration with GPT-4 and embeddings
- ✅ Comprehensive RAG service with vector storage and retrieval
- ✅ Health knowledge base seeding (20+ evidence-based documents)
- ✅ Advanced vector retrieval and context injection system
- ✅ API usage monitoring and cost optimization

**Task 2.0 - Snap-Based Fasting Timer** (5/7 sub-tasks completed):
- ✅ **2.1**: Comprehensive fasting service with timer logic, state persistence, multiple fasting types (16:8, 18:6, 20:4, OMAD, extended), engagement tracking, RAG integration
- ✅ **2.2**: Beautiful circular timer UI with animated progress indicators, custom painters, pulse animations, interactive controls
- ✅ **2.3**: Snap-to-start/end functionality integrated with camera triggers, visual fasting status indicators, contextual camera controls
- ✅ **2.4**: Comprehensive motivational AR filters and lenses system with 8 unique filter types (motivational text, progress ring, achievement, strength aura, time counter, willpower boost, zen mode, challenge mode), AI-powered content generation using RAG, progress-based unlocking, beautiful selection UI
- ✅ **2.5**: **JUST COMPLETED** - Aggressive food content filtering system with comprehensive content analysis, AI-powered filtering using OpenAI, multi-layered detection (keywords + AI), adaptive severity levels based on fasting progress, beautiful filtered content widgets, alternative motivational content generation, story/chat integration with content filtering
- ⏳ **2.6**: Create fasting mode state management across app navigation
- ⏳ **2.7**: Add visual cues (badges, color shifts) for fasting status

## What's Left to Build

**Phase II Priority Tasks**:
- **Task 2.0**: Complete remaining 3 fasting timer sub-tasks (content filtering, state management, visual cues)
- **Task 3.0**: AI-Powered Meal Recognition and Logging System (7 sub-tasks)
- **Task 4.0**: Enhanced Stories with Logarithmic Permanence (6 sub-tasks)
- **Task 5.0**: Health-Focused Community Features (6 sub-tasks)
- **Task 6.0**: Personalized AI Advice Engine (7 sub-tasks)
- **Task 7.0**: Health App Integrations & Data Export (7 sub-tasks)
- **Task 8.0**: User Experience Transformation (7 sub-tasks)

## Known Issues

- **No critical issues remain** - All major bugs have been resolved
- **RESOLVED: Additional code compilation errors** (January 2025):
  - Fixed missing `getSenderData` method in SnapService - replaced with proper `getUserData` call to FriendService
  - Fixed `ViewSnapPage` constructor parameter mismatch - updated to use DocumentSnapshot instead of separate snapId and snapData
  - App now compiles and runs successfully on iOS
- **RESOLVED: UI Layout Issues** (January 2025):
  - Fixed multiple Expanded widgets conflict in FriendsPage causing RenderBox layout errors
  - Restructured FriendsPage layout to use proper constraints and scrolling
  - Fixed SnapUserSearch widget layout issues with shrinkWrap and proper physics
  - Added missing `getOrCreateOneOnOneChatRoom` method to FriendService
  - Resolved back button navigation issues in friends search functionality
  - **Fixed duplicate method declaration**: Removed duplicate `getOrCreateOneOnOneChatRoom` method causing compilation error
- 3 minor async context warnings (properly guarded with mounted checks)
- The project currently uses temporary, open security rules for both Firestore and Firebase Storage. These must be properly secured before production deployment.

## Next Steps

- Deploy to production with proper Firebase security rules
- Monitor performance and user feedback
- Consider advanced features like AR filters
