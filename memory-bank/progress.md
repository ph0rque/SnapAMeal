## Known Issues

- **Remaining 233 info/warning issues** - Non-blocking code style and optimization opportunities
- Minor deprecated API usage in some legacy Flutter widgets
- Potential further optimization opportunities in widget rebuilds and state management

## Technical Debt

- Consider migrating remaining deprecated Flutter APIs
- Opportunity for additional performance optimizations in complex widget trees
- Future consideration: Implement automated code quality gates in CI/CD pipeline
