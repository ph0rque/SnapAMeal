# Progress

## What Works

-   A basic "Hello World" application has been created.
-   The app displays a logo and text.
-   The app has been successfully run on both the Chrome web environment and an iOS simulator.
-   The development environment is confirmed to be working for iOS, macOS, and web.

## What's Left to Build

-   Everything else. The current application is just a placeholder.

## Known Issues

-   The iOS simulator was not initially detected by Flutter. This was resolved by creating a new simulator instance.
-   The Android development environment is not yet configured.
